        <h2>Lesson 3: Critical Thinking with Media</h2>
        <p>This lesson teaches you how to check information and protect yourself from false or fake news.</p>

        <h3>Passage (Scenario): Checking the News</h3>
        <p>Fahima hears on the radio that a new health center is opening in her town. A neighbor also saw the same news in a newspaper. They verify by calling the radio station, and it is true. The news helps people know where to go for help. Later, Fahima sees a social media post saying “Poor quality medicine causes illness!” She waits for confirmation, because she remembers: not everything online is true.</p>

        <h3>Vocabulary 📚</h3>
        <table class="vocab-table">
            <thead>
                <tr><th>English Word</th><th>Definition</th><th>Persian (Farsi) Translation</th></tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr><td><strong>News</strong></td><td>Information about recent events.</td><td>خبر</td></tr>
                <tr><td><strong>Source</strong></td><td>Where information comes from.</td><td>منبع</td></tr>
                <tr><td><strong>Verify</strong></td><td>Check if something is true.</td><td>تایید کردن</td></tr>
                <tr><td><strong>Reliable</strong></td><td>Trustworthy.</td><td>قابل اعتماد</td></tr>
                <tr><td><strong>False/Fake news</strong></td><td>Incorrect information.</td><td>خبر غلط</td></tr>
                <tr><td><strong>Rumor</strong></td><td>Unconfirmed story.</td><td>شایعه</td></tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h3>Key Concepts: Verifying Information</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Always **check sources**. Trust official reports or well-known journalists. If Fahima hears something important (like a health center), she **verifies** by contacting the source. Trusted news keeps people safe.</li>
            <li>Be careful with social media **rumors**. Not all posts are true. Fahima did the right thing by waiting to verify. You can also check official websites or ask community leaders.</li>
            <li>**Empowerment through media:** By using media wisely, women can stay informed and help others. Being critical and asking questions helps uphold the mission of media programs that aim to connect women to education.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Practice Exercises 💪</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>True or False:</strong> If you see a shocking claim on social media, you should believe it without question.</li>
            <li><strong>Fill in the blank:</strong> A \_\_\_\_\_ source is one you can trust for correct information.</li>
            <li>Why is it important to check news on radio or ask neighbors?</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>💡 Lesson Answers</h4>

            <li><strong>Answer:</strong> reliable.</li>
            <li><strong>Answer:</strong> To make sure it’s true and not a rumor.</li>

        <h3>Summary:</h3>
        <p>This lesson taught you to think carefully about media. We saw Fahima using radio and newspapers to **confirm** news, and being cautious about online posts. Remember to **check information before believing it**. By doing so, you help others stay safe and informed, just like media programs aim to do for women in Afghanistan.</p>
