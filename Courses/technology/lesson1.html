        <h3>Key Concepts: Smartphones as Mini-Computers</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Modern **smartphones** are like small computers. They have **apps** for texting, browsing internet, and even banking. If you see the letters 3G or **4G** on your phone, that means you can use mobile internet.</li>
            <li>Always **secure your device**. Use a **password** or PIN so others cannot misuse it. Only download apps from **trusted sources**.</li>
            <li>For example, a new Afghan service called **HesabPay** allows women to have a **digital bank account** on their phone. With this, aid money can be sent to their phone, and they can spend it in local shops without long queues.</li>
        </ul>
