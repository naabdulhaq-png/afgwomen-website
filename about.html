        <h2>About AFGWomen: Our Commitment to Education and Empowerment</h2>
        <h3>Our Mission and Values</h3>
        <p>AFGWomen is a non-profit institution dedicated to providing accessible, high-quality online education and vocational training to Afghan women. Founded on the core principles of equity, resilience, and knowledge, our mission is to empower women who face systemic barriers to traditional learning. We are driven by the belief that education is the most powerful tool for fostering independence, economic stability, and community leadership.</p>
        <h3>Addressing the Need</h3>
        <p>In environments where access to physical schools and safe learning spaces is often restricted, online education serves as a crucial lifeline. Our programs are specifically designed to meet the practical and professional needs of women, allowing them to pursue knowledge and skills without geographical constraints. We focus on in-demand areas—from digital literacy and business management to essential language training—to ensure every lesson translates directly into real-world opportunity and self-sufficiency.</p>
        <h3>Our Commitment to Quality and Accessibility</h3>
        <p>We are committed to delivering a learning experience that is not only accessible but exceptional. Our platform provides structured courses, downloadable workbooks, and mentorship opportunities, enabling our students to master new disciplines at their own pace. By operating as a non-profit, we ensure that financial barriers are minimized, making empowerment truly reachable for all who seek it.</p>
        <p><strong>We are not just offering classes; we are building a foundation for a stronger, more independent future, one dedicated student at a time.</strong></p>
