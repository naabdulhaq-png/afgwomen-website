        <h3>Passage (Story): Jamila Finds Customers</h3>
        <p>After Jamila made scarves, she needed customers. She went to the village bazaar.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Jamila (selling at market):</strong> “Good morning! Hand-embroidered scarves – each for 300 AFN.”</p>
            <p><strong>Customer:</strong> “They are beautiful! I’ll buy two.”</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>She smiles and packs them. Jamila also posted pictures of her scarves on a local WhatsApp group. Soon she got more orders.</p>
