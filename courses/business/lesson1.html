        <h3>Key Concepts: Defining Business and Profit</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>A **business** is when you create or sell something (a product or service) to earn money. **Entrepreneurship** means turning an idea into reality. For example, Amina’s idea is to sell scarves she makes. Every business needs a simple plan.</li>
            <li>**Profit** is the money a business keeps after paying for all costs. If Amina sells a scarf for 100 AFN, and it cost her 70 AFN in fabric and labor, then her profit is 30 AFN. Businesses aim to have some profit to cover family needs or reinvest.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Practice Exercises 💪</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>True or False:</strong> A business always makes a profit.</li>
            <li><strong>Fill in the blank:</strong> In a business, the customer is the person who ____ something.</li>
            <li>Amina sells scarves. She charges 150 AFN per scarf. It costs her 100 AFN to make each scarf. How much profit does she make per scarf?</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>💡 Lesson Answers</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Answer:</strong> False. (Sometimes a business has expenses more than income, so it has no profit.)</li>
            <li><strong>Answer:</strong> buys.</li>
            <li><strong>Answer:</strong> 50 AFN (150 AFN − 100 AFN costs = 50 AFN profit).</li>
        </ol>
