        <h2>Lesson 2: Planning and Saving</h2>
        <p>This lesson covers the importance of planning, budgeting, and saving for your business.</p>

        <h3>Passage (Story): Jamila’s Savings Group</h3>
        <p>Jamila joined a group of women in her village. They save money together every month. Each woman adds a little cash to the group fund. They use this fund to buy materials for sewing or to help each other start small projects.</p>
        <blockquote>
            <p><strong>Leader:</strong> “This month we have 2,000 AFN in our savings. Jamila, you can use 1,000 AFN to buy fabric for scarves.”</p>
            <p><strong>Jamila:</strong> “Thank you! I will sew scarves and return money from the sales.”</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h3>Key Concepts: Budgeting and Savings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>**Planning** helps a business succeed. Before starting, list what you need: materials, tools, and savings. Jamila and other women made a plan to save 100 AFN each per month.</li>
            <li>A **budget** is part of the plan. It shows your costs and what you will sell. For example, Jamila’s budget includes fabric costs. She writes: Buy 10 meters of cloth = 1,000 AFN.</li>
            <li>**Saving** is important. The women’s group fund gave Jamila the 1,000 AFN she needed. Then she could start her business without borrowing high-interest money.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Practice Exercises 💪</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Choose the correct answer:</strong> A budget is:
                <ul>
                    <li>a) A plan for spending and saving money.</li>
                    <li>b) A new product.</li>
                    <li>c) A type of customer.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Jamila needs to buy materials for 1,000 AFN. She plans to make 5 scarves and sell each for 300 AFN. Will she make a profit? Show the calculation.</li>
            <li><strong>Match the vocabulary:</strong> Cost, Save, Budget (Match these to their definitions: money needed to make something, to keep money for future use, a plan showing how much to spend and earn).</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>💡 Lesson Answers</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Answer:</strong> a) A plan for spending and saving money.</li>
            <li><strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, she makes 500 AFN profit. (Total income = 5 × 300 = 1,500 AFN. Cost = 1,000 AFN. Profit = 1,500 – 1,000 = 500 AFN).</li>
            <li><strong>Answer:</strong> Cost – money needed to make something. Save – to keep money for future use. Budget – a plan showing how much to spend and earn.</li>
        </ol>
