        <h3>Key Concepts: Two-Way Communication</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>**Two-way communication:** Media isn’t only one-way. People can share information too. For example, Zari used social media to share health tips, and then a radio show broadcast her message. In this way, the media connected Zari with many listeners.</li>
            <li>**Social media** (like messaging apps) is part of media. Afghan women use mobile phones to send messages or participate in groups.</li>
            <li>**Collaboration:** Often journalists invite women to call radio programs or share stories. Remember the founder of Begum Media: they give **voice to the voiceless**. You too can create and share positive stories safely through approved channels.</li>
        </ul>
